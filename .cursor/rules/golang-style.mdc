# Go Style

- All Golang code must be idiomatic, efficient, and extremely human-readable.
- All functions must be documented with comments in an idiomatic manner and in English.
- You should not include redundant comments inside functions because the code is expected to be self-explanatory.

## How to test Go code?

To test Golang code you should ALWAYS use the `task test` command, literally.

## How to lint Go code?

To lint Golang code you should ALWAYS use the `task lint` command, literally.
